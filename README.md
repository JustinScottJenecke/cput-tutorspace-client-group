## Stack change 25-July-21 - Project was changed from PHP web application to static website

    - Project was changed from a web application to a static website, as the server-side code will be built
      as a separate application, instead of being integrated with the website.
    
    - Reason for this is so frontend and backend code can be segregated, as they will have two different teams working
      on them simultaneously.
