# Stack change 25-July-21 - Project was changed from PHP web application to static website

    - Project was changed from a web application to a static website, as the server-side 
      code will be built as a separate application, instead of being integrated with the 
      website.
    
    - Reason for this is so frontend and backend code can be segregated, as we will 
      have two different teams working on them simultaneously.
