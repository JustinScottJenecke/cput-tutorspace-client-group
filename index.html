                <p>The target audience of our proposed system are mostly, but also not limited to
                    University and College students who are required to study remotely, the tutors offering
                    tutoring services, and any student who lacks the means or resources to self-study or
                    study remotely efficiently. </p>
                <p>We are building this system to assist students and tutors by providing them with a
                    platform to supplement studentâ€™s learning, to give tutors a medium to advertise and
                    market their services during lockdown and to provide students struggling to study
                    remotely, an opportunity to get assistance in a more personal and attentive setting than
                    an online classroom.</p>
